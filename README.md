# eosio-challenge

Release Notes

- To my best knowloedge the code is fully functional
- As with any first release of software, there might exist bugs, however they can be fixed with little effort
- Implements compatibility multiple releases
- Compatible with geth
- Self contained, all code was written, no 3rd party library used
- Everything my IP
- Lessa than xKb
- I value readability and code reuse, usually not compatible with hackathon spirit

Known issues

- Slow EXPMOD

Considerations

- The spec was not fully specific, so I assumed that by first submission
was subjective in the sense that a more complete submission made later
could disqualify a less complete submited later, therefore I decided to
spend a little more time on delivering a more complete version, despite
the fact that it could take more time
- I also assume that for the prize of the challenge EOSIO would also consider
important the quality, therefore I put an effort to provide a more readable and
reusable code
